* m1
GNU/Linux on an Apple M1-based MacBook Pro

Platform name (SMC =RPlt=, ADT): J293

** Software

*** Boot loader

I sometimes use m1n1 at [https://github.com/AsahiLinux/m1n1], particularly for development.

*** Preloader

Corellium preloader at [https://github.com/corellium/preloader-m1], modified version.

*** Linux kernel

Based on the Corellium repo at [https://github.com/corellium/linux-m1], currently Linux 5.13-rc3

*** Distribution

Debian GNU/Linux sid, [https://www.debian.org].

*** Windowing System

X.org, [https://www.xorg.freedesktop.org].

*** CPU: supported

Apple M1 SOC. Four "performance" cores plus four "efficiency" cores each implementing identical ARM64/AArch64-compatible instruction sets.

**** CPU power management: supported

*** GPU: unsupported

Apple M1 SOC.

*** Video output: supported, no acceleration

**** Frame buffer: supported

2560x1600 =x8r8g8b8= frame buffer, supported through the simple-framebuffer driver.

**** Bitblt: not supported(?)

I'm not sure about that one, as video operations seem very fast...

**** LCD backlight: disabling documented, no brightness control

*** Video codec acceleration: not supported

*** Camera: not supported
*** Fingerprint reader: not supported
*** Power button: documented, no interrupt yet

Long-press for poweroff works

SMC key =MBSe=, bit 0.

*** Lid switch: documented, no interrupt yet

SMC key =MSLD=, bit 0, 1 for closed.

*** Ambient Light Sensor: not supported
*** Audio: not supported

*** Keyboard: supported
**** keyboard backlight: supported, not yet merged
*** Touch pad: supported
*** Touch bar: not supported
**** Touch bar display: not supported
**** Touch bar touchscreen: not supported
**** Touch bar backlight: not supported

*** USB host mode: supported
*** USB power-receiving mode: not supported

Charging works if power supply is connected at boot time and never
disconnected.

Charging also works if the relevant port is removed from the device
tree and thus left untouched by Linux.

*** Storage
**** NVME storage: supported
**** SPI NOR flash (boot ROM): supported
**** NVRAM: supported
**** RTC: supported
**** USB mass storage: supported

*** Hardware sensors
**** Temperature sensors: documented
**** Power meters: documented
**** Voltage meters: documented
**** Battery status: documented
*** Fans: read-only access documented
**** Fan status: documented
**** Fan control: not supported

*** Audio: not supported

*** Wireless
**** WiFi: supported (proprietary firmware blob)
**** Bluetooth: not supported
**** NFC: not supported (I'm not even sure it's present)

*** Power management
**** System reboot: supported
**** System poweroff: supported
**** System suspend/resume: not supported

*** RTC: supported
